When I was a university student I took PSP (Personal Software Process) class, I really liked the idea of creating quality software. In this class I was taught in general terms how this methodology is used in the professional industry but It was until my first job when I really understand how to use it.

It all began in 2013 when I was in my first job as a software engineer. We wanted to make better projects following professional practices such as estimating better software development time, tracking time of the tasks, and creating software with zero bugs. 

I was taught in the university that perhaps the best methodology was PSP and TSP. 
In the consulting company where I worked I had to do a lot of software documentation following the documents from CMMI such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, gantt charts, project charters, etc. This led my team and I decide to learn how to use PSP and TSP. I took two courses from the SIE Center(Software Industry Excellence Center): PSP Fundamentals and Advanced. They were taught by an instructor with a PhD who specialized in CMMI, PSP and TSP.

In these courses I had to do ten programming assignments all following the principles of PSP: planning, development and  postmortem. I also had to use a software called Process Dashboard. At the end I passed an online exam and received the PSP Certification, which lasted 3 years.
Process Dashboard is a free software that helped me a lot when we were implementing PSP/TSP in my job.
PSP and TSP collects statistics from the Process Dashboard software and give us an accurate estimate of the development time and size taking  as input size (lines of code), time, and quality(bugs).

PSP uses forms or scripts which are helpful because you analyze the program that you will code in detail. The purpose of these is generate statistics that will be used in future programs, and in the end will help to improve the performance of the developer.
Once you create the project there are six phases: planning, design, code, compile,test and postmortem. 
The scripts that uses the Process Dashboard for recollecting data are the following:


- The project plan summary
- The process script
- The planning script
- The development script
- The postmortem script

When I had to code the assignments I had to record everything such as time spent in each phase, the bugs found in each phase, the interruption time in each phase(rest time, telephonic calls, etc), etc. I have to be very disciplined in order to use it properly. 

In PSP/ TSP each engineer have to plan his work according to his personal data, and if you do not have data at least at the beginning, you have to estimate your work. Once I was done with the assignment I had to do a report where I analyzed  the results in order to improve my performance in a process called Process Improvement Proposal (PIP), in this document I wrote about the problems I faced during all the process,  divided in problem description and proposal description.
When I finished the assignment I had to sent the process data file, source code, test results, test report and and PIP form to the instructor and then he graded me, if everything was OK I was accepted but if not I had to resubmit. 

In conclusion PSP/TSP taught me how to follow a methodology and it was my first approach to developing software following professional practices.
